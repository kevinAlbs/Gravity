## About ##
This was made for the Mini Ludum Dare #48. We chose the theme of deceit.

## TODO ##
- [done] HUD with enforced number of gravity switches
- Sprite for guy
- Stages
- Add death counter
- Tutorial/Instructions/Menu screen

## Issues ##
- [fixed?] Floating outside platform bug
- A bit of fluctuation on platforms (might be due to how I check if the player is on a platform)
